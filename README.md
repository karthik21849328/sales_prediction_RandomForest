Model Building and Evaluation
1. Store the target column (i.e.Sales) in the y variable and the rest of the columns in
the X variable.
2. Split the dataset into two parts (i.e. 70% train and 30% test) using
random_state=42.
3. Train a Decision tree model
4. Train multiple Decision tree models with different values for max_depth and
max_features
5. Check the importance of features as per the Decision Tree
6. Train a Random Forest model
